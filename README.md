# xv_11_laser_driver_humble_edit

I have modified the noetic driver from the repository suggested by [ros.org documentation](https://wiki.ros.org/xv_11_laser_driver/Tutorials) to work on ros2 humble

- Edited drive: https://github.com/rohbotics/xv_11_laser_driver.git

- Works with the arduino controller: https://github.com/getSurreal/XV_Lidar_Controller.git in arduino pro micro (leonardo)
